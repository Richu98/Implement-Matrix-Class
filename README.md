# Implement-Matrix-Class
This project focus on focus on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.

## Pre-requisite
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
          or
- [Juypter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
  
How to use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks)?

## List of Files and what it does
- **matrix.py** - This contains the beginnings of a Matrix classas well as some helper functions zeroes and identity.
- **matrix_playground.ipynb** - A notebook that imports your Matrix class and calls the test code.
- **matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb** - A Jupyter notebook with a glossary, explanation of matrix notation and list of matrix equations
- **kalman_filter_demo.ipynb** - Kalman Filter implementation from the Matrix.py
- **test.py** - Contains test code which demonstrates the expected functionality of your code.
- **datagenerator.py** - this just contains some helper code which is used by the Kalman Filter.
